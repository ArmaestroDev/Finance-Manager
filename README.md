# Finance Manager

**Finance Manager** is a modern, cross-platform personal finance application built with **React Native (Expo)**. It provides a unified view of your financial health by aggregating data from your bank accounts via Open Banking APIs, tracking manual assets, and calculating your total net worth in real-time.

Designed for privacy and performance, it runs seamlessly on **iOS**, **Android**, and **Web**, with a serverless backend optimized for **Vercel**.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Unified Dashboard**: Get a snapshot of your Total Net Worth, broken down by asset class (Giro, Savings, Stocks, Cash).
- **Bank Integration**: Securely connect to thousands of banks across Europe using the **Enable Banking API**.
- **Smart Sync**: Real-time balance updates with a manual refresh option to bypass caching layers.
- **Manual Accounts**: Track physical cash, precious metals, or off-grid assets manually.
- **Cross-Platform**:
  - **Mobile**: Native performance on iOS and Android.
  - **Web**: Fully responsive web app with special handling for Safari/iPad popup blockers.
- **Privacy First**:

  - **Local Storage**: Session keys and cached balances are stored securely on your device.
- **Customization**: Automatic Dark/Light mode support and English/German localization.
